The terrain model resolves catchment drainage at a scale far coarser than a
single storm drain, so a route crossing a built-up block says water runs
downhill across it, not that a channel exists there.

What the trace is good for is naming the ground that receives what a plot sheds,
and ranking it by how much catchment concentrates there. What it cannot say is
that the water arrives, because arrival depends on a drain network this tool
does not hold. A downstream finding is a lead for verification, the same way a
drainage finding is.
